It involves reassignment of employees instead of mass layoffs. This method has both benefits and drawbacks for the employers and employees alike. While quiet cutting may save money for the company, it can have negative impacts on employee morale, mental health, and engagement if not handled properly. Companies should carefully consider their approach to handling changes in the workplace, considering the pros and cons of different options, including providing employees with some say in the process."
