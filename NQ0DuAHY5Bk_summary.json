    "llama3-gradient:8b": "This assistant's summary is as follows:\n\nThe video discusses the topic of an AI project called \"Bullie\", which has recently gained attention. The project, according to the transcript, started with a community that was very engaged and had good distribution among its holders. It also states that the project currently sits at 143 million in market value. The project's main feature is its use of Doos, a viral account that can generate memes from any image or video, which makes it seem like there may be a lot of room for this type of project to grow. The assistant notes that the project does not have a lot of influencers yet and therefore has not had a huge boom in price. However, some interesting events have occurred recently. For example, Doos is now eligible to pay creators through its revenue sharing program, although this time it will be used to buy back BULLIE tokens and return them to the community as \"tips\". The assistant also notes that Nolan, a well known figure who was one of the first people to get access to Elon Musk's Neuralink, has started an AI-based meme project. He has sent out his wallet address and so far 80% of the supply of the token has been donated to him. After he took the majority of the donations, BULLIE has gone down by 90%, but it seems to be going back up again. The assistant does not have any personal recommendations for this project at this time but wants people to do their own research and decide for themselves if they want to get in. They also mention that there is one other token called \"Quant\", which had a lot of hype around it, but its price has dropped 99% and it may be a good buy opportunity as it seems to be going back up at this time. The assistant also suggests people add the Bullie project to their watch lists on platforms like Dex Screener or others so they can stay aware of any potential future events that may affect the value of its token."
