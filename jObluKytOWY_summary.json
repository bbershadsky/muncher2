    "llama3-gradient:8b": "Here is a concise summary of the YouTube video transcript:\n\nThe creator, who is an expert at summarizing YouTube videos, talks about his work and how he can summarize any video. He says that he is not a financial advisor so people should use their own discretion when it comes to making investment decisions based on the information he shares. The person also notes that there are risks to investing in defi such as divergence loss. For example, if an investor thinks the price of an asset (in this case Soul) will go down and they invest in USDC but at some point later, they have no choice but sell their USDC into the same asset. The expert also notes that there is a good amount of trading activity over on the salana network which shows how powerful it is as a service business model right now. He also mentions the current price of Soul to be $257 and has selected 2011 liquidity pools in Orca, an uniswap fork, for his example. The person has filtered by asset type (Soul) and set a range on metrics finance that he uses to select a pool with a good return. This shows how you can find liquidity pools using the filter option on the site. He is not a financial advisor so it is up to each investor if they want to use his advice or not. The expert also tells people to subscribe to the channel and click the bell for future notifications. In addition, he invites viewers to join the defi Excel community with the link in the description."
