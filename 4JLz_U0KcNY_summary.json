  "summary": "**Nuclear-Powered Aircraft**\n\n* The idea of using nuclear energy for pacemakers was first explored in the late 1960s.\n* A pilot program was implemented, with around 600 pacemakers implanted worldwide (estimates vary).\n* These early pacemakers used plutonium-238 as a power source, which has a long half-life of 88 years.\n* The pacemakers were not designed to generate electricity but instead relied on the heat produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 to produce a small voltage.\n* Despite their innovative design, concerns about safety and disposal led to a halt in further development and deployment.\n\n**Nuclear-Powered Bombers**\n\n* Both the Soviet Union and the United States explored nuclear-powered bombers during the Cold War era.\n* The Soviet Union's Tu-19 bomber was designed with turboprop engines powered by both nuclear fuel and paraffin, while the United States considered a direct cycle system where air would be heated by the reactor and then expelled through a jet engine.\n* Neither project progressed beyond the theoretical stage due to concerns about safety and environmental risks.\n\n**Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Accidents**\n\n* In 2001, scavengers dismantled two RTGs (Radioactive Thermoelectric Generators) on the Cola Peninsula, leading to radioactive contamination.\n* International efforts have been made to secure or dismantle abandoned nuclear-powered lighthouses in Russia and other countries has led to more than half of the Nuclear powered pacemaker.\n* The exact status of these devices remains unclear as some sources suggest that they were dealt with before diplomatic breakdown between Russia.",
