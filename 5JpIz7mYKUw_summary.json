    "llama3-gradient:8b": "The video features Russian billionaire Dimitri Sergeev who also made a fortune as a media magnet. He is dedicated to his project, Avatar, which is about creating an alternative for human bodies. The first step in this process is making an avatar head that can be controlled remotely by the brain and eventually allow people to transfer their consciousness into it. A robot with an avatar head could potentially help individuals who are paralyzed or have other mobility issues. According to Dimitri, they need 5 more years of study before the technology is ready for humans. He also hopes to use the technology in the future to be able to live as a hologram and will be happy if he can provide an \"Avatar\" which could help someone with paralysis. The video includes footage of Dimitri discussing his project in Dallas, Texas. He said that the idea for the Avatar is criticized but this has not stopped him from continuing to move forward with it."
