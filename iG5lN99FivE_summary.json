    "llama3-gradient:8b": "Expert Summary:\n\nThe video presents a YouTube video transcript about market analysis. The speaker, who claims to be an expert, believes that Bitcoin (BTC) will have a bullish week in the coming days and possibly make new highs. He sees the upcoming week as the last chance for a medium-term top before it starts a strong rally into 2023. He thinks there is a possibility of two or three good days this week with the prices going up to the $93,000 zone. The speaker also believes that the daily charts are forming a Bearish Wedging Pattern (BWP) but does not confirm that BWP as it only has one extreme peak on the upper line. He states that if the price of Bitcoin is still above 93,500 by the end of this week and into next week or early January 2023, he would be surprised to see a drop in its value below $88,000, where there is another strong level (Gap). The speaker does not confirm that there will be a new high for sure but thinks it is very likely. If confirmed, the BWP on the daily chart will be a good sign of a major high coming up soon. He also talks about the double extreme stream signal that he has been referring to in previous videos as a Dependable (Highly Reputable) indication of when we may see some kind of correction before new highs come. According to him, if this happens on the daily chart and is confirmed by a strong rally into 2023 after the next correction, it will be another good sign that a major high is coming soon. If there are any corrections this week or the next one, he says they would be short-term. He believes that even though a medium-term top is possible, the market direction is still going to be up and to the right into 2023. The speaker also provides information about Black Friday sale where the code for an advanced offer price is \"black\" in all capital letters (BLACK)."
