    "llama3-gradient:8b": "Here is the concise transcript:\n\n[Intro Music]\nSpeaker: Welcome to \"How To Win Friends And Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie.\n\n[Segment 1]\nSpeaker: The first step in making people like you is to show that you are genuinely interested in them.\nWhen talking with someone, keep your ears wide open. Listen actively and make eye contact\nwith the person as you speak. Never interrupt, even when you know what they are going to say or think.\nAlways talk about the other fellow's interests.\n\n[Segment 2]\nSpeaker: The second principle is don't criticize. Criticism can be destructive if not done in a good-natured way,\nand it must never appear as an attempt to injure, so always be friendly and never\ncriticize at first.\nIf you are going to criticize somebody, make sure you know all the facts; otherwise your criticism is based\non incomplete information.\n\n[Segment 3]\nSpeaker: The third principle is never advise unless asked. In other words, don't volunteer advice unless you have a\nspecial reason for doing so. Advice and instruction will be most effective when you are in your field of expertise.\nIf you know nothing about the subject or aren't an expert, it's best to keep quiet.\n\n[Segment 4]\nSpeaker: The fourth principle is make the fault seem easy to correct. Don't tell people how much they should improve\nor what you think their shortcomings are but instead show them that those faults can be corrected by giving specific advice and in a\nfriendly manner that makes them feel at ease.\nIf you want people to change, get them to take an active part in the improvement process.\n\n[Segment 5]\nSpeaker: The fifth principle is consult on how they may do better. When giving criticism, make it seem as though you are asking the\nother fellow's opinion.\nAsk for suggestions and encourage others' ideas.\n\n[Segment 6]\nSpeaker: If you want to improve your personal relationships ask yourself, am I in the right place? Are these people who can help me? Have I got some way of helping them?\n\n[Outro Music]\n\nNote: This is a summarized version. There are no ads as per my request."
