The first lesson is that one should not compare oneself with others because, like a mirror, your life is a reflection of what you have created and it will change when you do. He advises against blaming other people or circumstances. People should make time for the things that matter most in their lives and take on as much responsibility as they can. It is never too late to change and you cannot blame anybody else but yourself if your life does not go the way you want it to, so take full control of it. The speaker also suggests that you respect people because of what they do or have achieved for others, not out of fear of them. \nKey points: \n\n* Blame nobody else but yourself and be responsible for where you are in your life.\n* Make time for things that matter to you.\n* Do not blame other people for the circumstances of your life.\n* You can make a change whenever you want to.\n* Respect others because of what they do, not out of fear. \n* It is never too late to change the way of life.\n* Blame nobody else but yourself if your life does not go as you wish it to.\n\nThese are all good life lessons that should be helpful to most people who watch this video.
