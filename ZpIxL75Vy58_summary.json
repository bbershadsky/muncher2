    "llama3-gradient:8b": "Here's the summary of the YouTube video transcript:\n\n**Summary by Expert**\n\nThe video discusses how an Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful tool in analyzing and summarizing a project very quickly. To use it exclusively is not recommended but as a means to speed up the research, it is definitely helpful. An expert can help you dig deep into a project and find information that may not have been covered yet by other AI tools or even other experts.\n\nThe video starts off with the introduction of an \"AI expert\" and mentions that some people might think this is Nick, but this is not Nick, instead it's someone else. The AI can be used to dig deep into a project very quickly, although it should not be the only source you use when conducting your research on a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nThe video goes over the steps in using an AI expert. This includes opening up a new chat window with GPT-3, which is the model they are using today, and asking the expert what information can be found about a particular project that the viewer is interested in researching. The AI will then give you all of the information that it can find on the topic of cryptocurrency. If the viewer has any questions or wants more details, he or she should let GPT know.\n\nThe AI will ask if there are any specific types of data that need to be found. This might include onchain metrics such as trading volume and circulating supply for a particular cryptocurrency. It also will provide information on exchanges where the cryptocurrency is listed.\n\nThere is no maximum supply of H&H tokens at the start, but this was later kept at 223 million. The H&H token can be used to reward hotspot providers and it can also be used to access certain network services. If there are any questions or concerns about what the AI has found, GPT will do its best to provide more information.\n\nGPT will also give you a list of exchanges that the cryptocurrency is listed on as well as the trading volume of each cryptocurrency. This information helps determine if the price is legitimate and not manipulated by some other exchange. The circulating supply includes 172 million H&H tokens, which makes up most of the 223 million that have been minted. There are no vesting schedules to be aware of.\n\nThe AI expert also mentions that there are three GPT plugins that you should know about: Defi Llama's plugin, Smarter Contracts' tool and Crypto Jobs List. The first is a list of all onchain metrics found in the Defi Llama model and it can do multiple searches at once. It can look for things such as TVL, top gainers/losers and emerging trends to help you identify the next opportunity.\n\nThe second plugin will analyze an evm compatible smart contract's address. This is a tool that any mem coin Deens out there would be able to use because it could detect if the token is a scam by looking for suspicious function or transaction history. The last plugin is Crypto Jobs List, which can help you find opportunities to work in this industry.\n\nThe video ends with an explanation of the AI's ability to speed up research and the fact that not everyone should be using it as their only source, even though it does provide a lot of useful information. However, there are also new tools being developed for AIS every day. This includes chatGPT plugins such as Crypto Jobs List.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.
