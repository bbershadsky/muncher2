  "summary": "of the main points:\n\n1. The author is cautious about using the Fear and Greed Index alone for trading decisions, as it can sometimes give false signals like in 2020 when the index was at 90 at 15k and then bitcoin rallied 4X. \n\n2. The author believes that if we get a print of 90% then it will likely be a pullback. \n\n3. It is suggested to watch for dominance because the dominance chart has this trend line broken again if it's going down.\n\n4. If the F index is at 90, it would seem like an all-time high but maybe I mean there would have been some bigger one after that point in this time we hit another pullback and then went up to 2000 and then a smaller pullback before hitting three times higher.",
