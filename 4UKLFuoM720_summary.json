This unusual wildlife encounter takes place near the Aerial Centre dock and surprises both tourists and staff alike.\n\n**Keywords:** wild, whale, VanCity, B.C., ocean, orca\n**Transcript:**\n(Starts at 0:04)\nAdrienne: [Sighs] Okay, thank you, Andrew. All right, next, passengers in a Vancouver ferry are treated to a wild sight.\nAndrew: There are approximately four Orca whales between the bridges. Everybody shift into neutral. They are kind of at the mercy of us, and they are a lot bigger and stronger than they look in film when you are that close. Yeah, you really take for granted how special Vancouver is, but there's not many places in the world where you're seeing Orca whales behind skyscrapers and mountains.\nAdrienne: Sometimes it blows my mind how extraordinary this country is. You know, and marine mammal researchers actually know those Orcas. It is a mom and her three offspring, and they have tracked them all the way from Alaska to the Juan de Fuca Strait and the first time in downtown Vancouver though.\n\n(Ends at 0:17)"
